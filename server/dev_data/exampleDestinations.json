The 12-kilometer Sentiero Azzurro stretches from Monterosso to Riomaggiore, but it's conveniently broken into segments that you can hike from one town to the next, returning or moving on by train."

They gather along the Grand Canal by the Doge's Palace and at Rialto Bridge, and you'll see them in their striped shirts and straw hats on bridges and canals as you explore the city.

While a driving tour can cover more of these towns, a bicycle gets you closer to the land and gives you time to notice more details."
