Whether you’re traveling solo, with family, or friends, Europe offers countless opportunities to mesmerize you. With easy access to so many diverse countries and cultures, you can wine and dine in the hills of Tuscany one day, and dance the Sardana through the streets of Barcelona the next. Bathe in the baths of Budapest or marvel in the beauty of the Northern Lights in Iceland. There are endless experiences, and Paradise Travel has just the right vacation packages to make it a trip you’ll never forget.",
    "regionAtGlance": "European countries welcome almost a half-billion international visitors per year. Not only is it the most popular destination for Americans traveling overseas, it’s also the easiest, thanks to an open borders policy, efficient travel infrastructure, a common currency, Euro in most of the individual countries. Traveling to Europe is quite simple for American citizens as a visa is not required for countries of the European Union and/or the 26 countries that fall under the Schengen Area (your Paradise Travel consultant will be happy to assist you with this). Once you land in any of these countries, your passport is stamped, leaving you free to travel across borders—so you can go from London to Paris to Netherlands seamlessly. Trains, budget airlines, and cars are the most popular ways to travel around this beautiful continent.",
